# Centrality-Measures

##Implementation of Centrality measures from scratch Without Using Networkx

## Centrality Measures:

1)Degree Centrality
2)Closeness Centrality
3)Betweenness Centrality
4)Eigenvector Centrality

## Input
Your functions should take as input an adjacency matrix and return a list or vector of centrality values.

## Associated Graph
A function that takes as input an adjacency matrix and plots in the notebook a depiction of the associated graph with 
eigenvector centrality represented by node size. Nodes can be represented as circles.
